              Mohali, officially known as Sahibzada Ajit Singh Nagar, is a city in the Mohali district of Punjab, India, and a prominent part of the tri-city region alongside Chandigarh and Panchkula.

Originally a small village, Mohali began its transformation in 1975, when it was developed as an extension of Chandigarh to accommodate growing population and government offices. The city was named in honor of Sahibzada Ajit Singh, the eldest son of Guru Gobind Singh, reflecting its deep Sikh heritage.

In the early years, Mohali was largely an industrial and residential hub, but it has since grown into a modern IT and sports city, home to IT parks, cricket stadiums, universities, and planned urban sectors. The city is also known for the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium, which has hosted many international cricket matches.

Today, Mohali is one of the fastest-growing cities in North India, offering a mix of tradition and modernity, and serving as a gateway to innovation, business, and tourism in Punjab.
